
TinyBrowser Installation Method 1
=================================

The standard TinyBrowser installation, this integrates TinyBrowser as a custom
file browseer with TinyMCE.

1) Copy the tinybrowser folder and contents to your TinyMCE plugins directory.

2) Place the following javascript link after the link to TinyMCE (tiny_mce.js):

   <script type="text/javascript"
   src="/tiny_mce/plugins/tinybrowser/tb_tinymce.js.php"></script>

   ***NOTE:*** The above link assumes TinyMCE is installed in your website root
   directory, you will need to amend the link to your specific setup!

3) Add this line to your TinyMCE init:

   file_browser_callback : "tinyBrowser"

4) Edit the TinyBrowser configuration file (config_tinybrowser.php). The most
   important settings are the file paths (these will be automatically created on
   your server by TinyBrowser if they do not exist) and also the security
   settings - if $_SESSION['tinybrowser']['sessioncheck'] is not configured you will only be
   able to browse files.

   ***NOTE:*** If your server is Unix-based. you may wish to modify the 
   $_SESSION['tinybrowser']['unixpermissions'] config value, which decides permissions.

5) All done! Now you will see a browse button in the TinyMCE dialog windows for
   plugins like image, media and link - just click this button and TinyBrowser
   will appear.


TinyBrowser Installation Method 2
=================================

This installation allows TinyBrowser to be used in 'stand-alone' mode, for
integration with any web application.

1) Copy the tinybrowser folder and contents to your server.

2) Place the following javascript link within the <head> tag on the page you
   require TinyBrowser:

   <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript"
   src="/tinybrowser/tb_standalone.js.php"></script>

   ***NOTE:*** The above link assumes TinyBrowser is installed in your website
   root directory, you will need to amend the link to your specific setup!

3) Edit the TinyBrowser configuration file (config_tinybrowser.php). The most
   important settings are the file paths (these will be automatically created on
   your server by TinyBrowser if they do not exist) and also the security
   settings - if $_SESSION['tinybrowser']['sessioncheck'] is not configured you will only be
   able to browse files.

   ***NOTE:*** If your server is Unix-based. you may wish to modify the
   $_SESSION['tinybrowser']['unixpermissions'] config value, which decides permissions.

4) To launch TinyBrowser use the following javascript function:

   tinyBrowserPopUp('type','elementid');

   'type' can contain 'image', 'media' or 'file' - corresponding to the type of
   file you want TinyBrowser to manage.

   'elementid' is the id of the page element you want populate with the file url
   TinyBrowser returns - this is generally a form text input. If you want to
   immediately display the image then create an <img> tag with the same element
   id, only suffixed with img - e.g. elementidimg.

   
TinyBrowser Installation Method 3
=================================

This installation method integrates TinyBrowser as a custom file browser with
FCKeditor.

1) Copy the tinybrowser folder and contents to your server.

2) Edit your fckconfig.js file as follows (replace existing lines).

   To enable TinyBrowser for files:
   FCKConfig.LinkBrowserURL = '/yourtinybrowserurl/tinybrowser.php?type=file';

   To enable TinyBrowser for images:
   FCKConfig.ImageBrowserURL = '/yourtinybrowserurl/tinybrowser.php?type=image';

   To enable TinyBrowser for Flash:
   FCKConfig.FlashBrowserURL = '/yourtinybrowserurl/tinybrowser.php?type=media';

   If you wish to disable the default FCKeditor file uploads (recommended), set
   the following:
   FCKConfig.LinkUpload = false;
   FCKConfig.ImageUpload = false;
   FCKConfig.FlashUpload = false;

3) Edit the TinyBrowser configuration file (config_tinybrowser.php).

   Change the $_SESSION['tinybrowser']['integration'] line:
   $_SESSION['tinybrowser']['integration'] = 'fckeditor';

   The other most important settings are the file paths (these will be
   automatically created on your server by TinyBrowser if they do not exist) and
   also the security settings - if $_SESSION['tinybrowser']['sessioncheck'] is not
   configured you will only be able to browse files.

   ***NOTE:*** If your server is Unix-based. you may wish to modify the
   $_SESSION['tinybrowser']['unixpermissions'] config value, which decides permissions.

4) All done! Now when you click the Browse Server button in the FCKeditor dialog
   windows for image, Flash and link, TinyBrowser will appear instead of the
   standard FCKeditor file browser.
