Configurations Guide
=======================

Recently TinyBrowser has been modified for better security enhancement. 
This might cause you some troubles in installing or running it. 

.htaccess
=========
htaccess.txt should be changed to .htaccess . It denies access to 
error log file by default.

If you want to see verbose error, you can set true to

$_SESSION['tinybrowser']['debug_mode'] = true;

to each configuration option.
